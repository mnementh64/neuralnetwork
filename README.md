# Neural Network project

The first goal of this project is to code a library able to make and run a perceptron neural network with any number of hidden layers. 
Activation function should be parametizable.

Two running modes are expected :

 * one to find the best hyper-parameters of a neural network for a case : with training, test and validation sets
 * the other more standard only with training and test sets

In a second time, it will be about changing the rules :
 
 * using different kind of hidden layers
 * disactivating some links between nodes
 * introducing genetic algorithm to help the network to learn better
 * ...
